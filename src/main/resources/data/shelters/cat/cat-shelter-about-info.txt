Our animal shelter or pound is a place where stray,
lost, abandoned or surrendered animals
– in our shelter there are cats – are housed.
The word "pound" has its origins in the animal
pounds of agricultural communities,
where stray livestock would be penned or impounded
until they were claimed by their owners.
