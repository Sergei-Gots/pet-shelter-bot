<b>Animal shelter</b>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
An animal shelter or pound is a place where stray, lost,
abandoned or surrendered animals – mostly dogs and cats – are housed.
The word "pound" has its origins in the animal pounds of agricultural communities, where stray livestock
would be penned or impounded until they were claimed by their owners.
