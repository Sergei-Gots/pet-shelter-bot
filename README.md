This is a spring-boot based maven project described with <b>pom.xml</b>
<br>
As database engine there is postgresQL data base server used.
Server is described in <b>resources/application.properties</b>
Name of the database is <b>pet_shelter_bot</b>
Database objects are described with <b>liquibase</b>-log available in <b>resources/db</b>
